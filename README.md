# Doodle Dectective
*This project is a demo for educational purposes as part of course*

Doodle Detective is a Kotlin mobile game where the user draws prompts to earn points. The app integrates an AI-powered Sketch Recognition model to evaluate the user's drawings; and if the prompt is among its top 5 guesses, then the user score a point.

This applications use the Sketch Recognition model from HuggingFace, which hosted on a local Flask server for cloud-based inference. The model can evaluates 100 prompts.
